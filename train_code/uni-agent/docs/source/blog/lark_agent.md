<!-- *Real example: the user asks for a digest of unresolved issues in a Lark group chat. The agent pulls recent messages through `lark-cli`, identifies the open threads, cross-references the people involved, embeds linked GitHub issues, and writes back as native Lark Markdown.* -->

## What It Can Do

### Use Lark in plain language

Through `lark-cli`, the agent can operate the Lark surface area your account can access, including:

- **Calendar**: "book 30 min with Miko next Tuesday afternoon"
- **Docs and Wiki**: "summarize this doc and send it to me"
- **Instant Messaging**: "what did Miko say about the launch last week?"
- **Mail**: "draft a polite decline to this Friday invite"
- **Meetings and Minutes**: "what did I commit to in yesterday's standup?"
- **Bitable, Sheets, Tasks, Contacts, Drive, Approval, Whiteboard, OKR, and more**: plug-and-play skill packs

### Remember the person, not just the chat

Two layers of persistence:

- **Per-chat transcript**: a JSON message log per `chat_id`, preserving OpenAI-shaped assistant/tool linkage so multi-turn conversations continue cleanly.
- **Long-term memory**: model-written files under the configured `memory_dir` (`/workspace/memory/` in the container for the `local_attach` deployment, or `~/.uni-agent/app/lark_chat/memory/` on the host for `local_native`) — `profile.md`, `preferences.md`, and topic notes.

The transcript captures what happened recently in this chat. Memory captures what should remain true tomorrow: your name, timezone, team, projects, language preference, recurring constraints, and the people you often mention.

If history is trimmed, the process restarts, or the container is recreated, memory still lives where it was written. The next Lark message picks up from there.

### Bring your own model

The app talks to any OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint. Self-hosted serving stacks like vLLM or SGLang, public APIs, or an internal model gateway all work the same way. The model is just config:

```yaml
model:
  base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1
  name: Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
  api_key: EMPTY
```

Big GPU box? Run the bigger model. Laptop demo? Point it at a smaller endpoint. The Lark integration stays the same.

## Step 0: Prerequisites and dependencies

- macOS or Linux
- Docker (used by the recommended `local_attach` deployment; not strictly required if you choose `local_native`)
- An OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint
- A Lark/Feishu app in the [Lark Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn)

Host-side dependencies are intentionally minimal. Clone the repo, create a virtualenv, install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yyDing1/uni-agent.git
cd uni-agent

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install swe-rex pydantic loguru orjson aiohttp openai pexpect pyyaml
```

## Step 1: Create a Lark bot

**Create a Lark bot and authorize it.**

- `npm install -g @larksuite/cli` to install the CLI; `lark-cli --version` to verify.
- `lark-cli config init --new`, creates a new app in the [Lark Open Platform](https://open.feishu.cn) (browser flow, captures `app_id` / `app_secret`).
- `lark-cli auth login`, OAuth device flow that binds the app to your Feishu account and grants its scopes.

The agent acts as this bot; its reach is exactly the scopes you authorized.

**Deploy in a sandbox (Optional).** Running LLM-generated shell directly against your host is risky on a personal machine. For isolation, spin up a Docker container first and run the same setup as above inside it (plus a `swerex.server` so the host process can attach over HTTP):

```bash
docker rm -f lark-chat-sandbox 2>/dev/null
docker run -d --name lark-chat-sandbox -p 18000:18000 \
  -v ~/.uni-agent/app/lark_chat/workspace:/workspace \
  nikolaik/python-nodejs:python3.12-nodejs22-bookworm tail -f /dev/null

docker exec -it lark-chat-sandbox bash -lc '
  set -e
  npm install -g @larksuite/cli
  pip install swe-rex
  lark-cli config init --new
  lark-cli auth login
  lark-cli auth status'

docker exec -d lark-chat-sandbox bash -lc '
  python3 -m swerex.server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 18000 --auth-token CHANGEME'
```

`CHANGEME` can be any string; just match it in Step 2.

## Step 2: Configure

Open `app/lark_chat/config.local_native.yaml`, the default config:

```yaml
deployment:
  type: local_native
  startup_timeout: 60.0

memory_dir: ~/.uni-agent/app/lark_chat/memory

model:
  base_url: http://localhost:8000/v1
  name: Qwen/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B
  api_key: EMPTY
  sampling_params:
    temperature: 1.0
    top_p: 0.95
    presence_penalty: 1.5
    top_k: 20
    repetition_penalty: 1.0

tools:
  - execute_bash
  - lark-cli
  - str_replace_editor
  - finish

skills_dir: ~/.agents/skills
transcripts_dir: ~/.uni-agent/app/lark_chat/transcripts

agent:
  action_timeout: 60
  max_steps_per_turn: 20
  history_max_tokens: 128000      # compaction trigger
  history_target_tokens: 32000    # post-compaction size
```

What each section does:

- `deployment`: where the agent's bash session runs. `local_native` runs in-process via `pexpect`; `startup_timeout` caps boot.
- `memory_dir`: long-term notes the agent writes (profile, preferences, topic memos). Survives restarts.
- `model`: any OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint. Two common setups:
  - **Self-hosted**: serve a model with vLLM or SGLang and point `base_url` at it (`api_key` can be any non-empty string).
  - **Hosted API**: e.g. Doubao Seed on Volc Ark, set `base_url: https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3`, `name: doubao-seed-1-6-250615` (or your model id), `api_key: <ARK_API_KEY>`.
- `sampling_params`: forwarded to the chat-completions call.
- `tools`: built-in tool wrappers exposed to the model.
- `skills_dir`: where `SkillsManager` finds skill packs (`lark-im`, `lark-base`, …).
- `transcripts_dir`: per-chat JSON trajectory logs (model messages + tool calls + results).
- `agent`: per-action timeout, max model steps per Lark turn, and a hysteresis-style history budget — `history_max_tokens` is the compaction trigger, `history_target_tokens` the size we compact back down to. While we stay under the trigger, the history is forwarded unchanged so the model server's prefix KV cache hits across turns.

**For `local_attach`**, edit `config.local_attach.yaml` and override just the `deployment` block + `memory_dir`; everything else stays the same:

```yaml
deployment:
  type: local_attach
  container: lark-chat-sandbox       # match docker run --name
  swerex:
    host: http://127.0.0.1
    port: 18000
    auth_token: CHANGEME             # match swerex.server --auth-token
  post_setup_cmd: cd /workspace

memory_dir: /workspace/memory        # container path; bind-mount /workspace to a host dir to persist memory across container restarts.
```

## Step 3: Run

```bash
python -m app.lark_chat.main
```

That picks up `config.local_native.yaml`. For `local_attach`, pass the config explicitly:

```bash
LOCAL_ATTACH_AUTH_TOKEN=CHANGEME \
  python -m app.lark_chat.main --config app/lark_chat/config.local_attach.yaml
```

(`LOCAL_ATTACH_AUTH_TOKEN` is only needed when `deployment.swerex.auth_token` is `null` in the YAML.)

You're live when you see:

```text
Entering chat loop. Send a Lark message to the bot.
```
