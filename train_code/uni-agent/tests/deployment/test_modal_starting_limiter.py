"""Tests for the Modal cold-start fleet limiter (2026-05-22 Patch).

Covers:
  * `_get_starting_semaphore` reads per-worker permits from
    MODAL_MAX_STARTING_PER_WORKER, is lazy, idempotent (singleton), and clamps to >=1.
  * `ModalDeployment.start` retry loop respects max_retries=2 (not 5).
  * `ModalDeployment.start` wall-clock budget aborts further attempts once
    `MODAL_INIT_WALL_BUDGET` is exceeded.
  * `asyncio.wait_for` inside the retry loop cancels a hung `_start`.
  * The STARTING semaphore actually serializes overlapping `_start` calls and
    is released on both success and failure paths.

We do NOT import or hit real modal.com. We bypass `ModalDeployment.__init__`
(which would invoke `_ImageBuilder.auto`) via `object.__new__` and manually
assign the few attributes the methods under test read.
